29,decrement,3,27,to reduce a flow in a predetermined and fixed manner. example: the gear train of a power screwdriver decrements the flow of rotational energy.
30,shape,3,27,"to mold or form a flow. example: in the auto industry, large presses shape sheet metal into contoured surfaces that become fenders, hoods and trunks."
31,condition,3,27,"to render a flow appropriate for the desired use. example: to prevent damage to electrical equipment, a surge protector conditions electrical energy by excluding spikes and noise (usually through capacitors) from the energy path."

35,convert,1,,"to change from one form of a flow (material, energy, signal) to another. for completeness, any type of flow conversion is valid. in practice, conversions such as convert electricity to torque will be more common than convert solid to optical energy. example: an electrical motor converts electricity to rotational energy"
